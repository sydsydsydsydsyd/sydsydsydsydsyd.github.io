# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For Project 0 I made a basic website about some things I like.

index.html is the homepage and it includes the side navigation bar as well as a
picture and a title.

books.html is a table listing some books on my shelf and whether or not i've
completed reading them. It also has a quote listed.

youtube.html is a collection of screenshots of youtube comments. I've had these
saved up and needed to know what to do with them. this is also where my
bootstrap component is, it is a slider so the user can display how much they like
youtube.

routine.html is a list of what i do almost every day and some bonus pictures
of me and my friends.

all of the .html files display a side navigation bar so every page can be accessed
by any of the others.

all the img files in the package are the pictures displayed on the website.
